- Repeat/rephrase the idea to show the understanding.
- Stay on topic.


## 3. What are the obstacles in your listening process?

- Listen fully before thinking about the response
- Take short notes to stay in the flow.


## 5. When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

I switch to a passive communication style when I don’t want conflict or when I feel the other person may get upset.


## 6. When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

I switch to an aggressive communication style when I feel stressed or overwhelmed.


## 7. When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

I switch to a passive-aggressive style when I feel upset but don’t want to express it directly. Sometimes I use sarcasm or stay silent when I feel ignored or treated unfairly.


## 8. How can you make your communication assertive?

By expressing my thoughts clearly without fear or anger. I should use “I” statements—like “I feel…” or “I need…”—so I speak for myself without blaming others.
