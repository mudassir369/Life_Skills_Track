# Tiny Habits

## 1. Most interesting story or idea from BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits video

- Small habits done consistently create big changes over time
- Instead of big changes all at once, focus on tiny habits that fit into your daily routine
- This approach is more effective and sustainable

## 2. How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A and P?

B = MAP means Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt

- **M (Motivation)** - Your desire to change and the reason why
- **A (Ability)** - How easy it is to do the habit. Remove obstacles to make it easier
- **P (Prompt)** - The trigger or reminder that tells you to do the habit

How to use it:
- Connect the habit to something you care about (increase motivation)
- Start with a smaller version and make it easy to do (increase ability)
- Tie it to something you already do daily like after coffee or brushing teeth (create prompt)

## 3. Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

- Celebration creates good feelings in your brain that make you want to repeat the habit
- Your brain remembers and repeats behaviors that feel rewarding
- Immediate celebration triggers dopamine - the "feel good" chemical that reinforces habits
- Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit - people return to things that make them feel good
- Small celebrations work - even a smile, fist bump, or saying "awesome!" triggers your brain's reward system
- Celebration is more powerful than willpower alone - it makes the habit automatic

## 4. Most interesting story or idea from 1% Better Every Day video

- If you improve just 1% every day, after one year you'll be 37 times better
- Small daily improvements compound and create huge results over time
- Success comes from systems and daily habits, not occasional big efforts
- Consistency matters more than intensity

## 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?

- Don't focus on what you want to achieve, focus on who you want to become
- Instead of "I want to lose weight," think "I am a healthy person"
- Every small action you do votes for the type of person you want to be
- When you see yourself as "a reader," reading becomes automatic
- When you see yourself as "fit," exercise becomes part of who you are
- Your habits shape your identity, and your identity reinforces your habits
- This creates a positive loop where identity and habits strengthen each other

## 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do

- Remove obstacles so the habit is easy to do
- Put things where you'll use them - gym clothes on your bed, book on your nightstand
- Make the habit obvious and visible in your environment
- Start with a tiny version - just 2 minutes instead of a full workout
- Attach the new habit to something you already do - meditate after coffee
- Automate choices so you don't have to decide every time
- Remove temptations - if you want to eat healthy, don't keep junk food at home
- Keep reminders visible
- Add a small reward to make it more enjoyable

## 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do

- Add steps between you and the bad habit - delete apps, log out of accounts
- Remove triggers - hide junk food, avoid certain places
- Turn off notifications and delete apps that tempt you
- Make it inconvenient - put your phone in another room
- Tell others your goal so they can help keep you accountable
- Replace the bad habit with a better one instead of just stopping
- Make the reward delayed and less appealing
- Rearrange your environment to reduce automatic behaviors

## 8. Pick one habit you'd like to do more of. What steps can you take?

**Example: Reading regularly**

- Keep the book visible on your nightstand or desk
- Set a daily reminder alarm
- Start with just 10-15 minutes a day
- Attach it to something you already do - read after morning coffee
- Choose books you enjoy reading
- Celebrate when you finish a reading session - smile and say "good job"
- Track your reading days on a calendar to see your streak grow

## 9. Pick one habit you'd like to eliminate. What steps can you take?

**Example: Reduce phone/social media scrolling**

- Delete social media apps from your phone
- Turn off all notifications
- Put your phone in another room during work
- Use grayscale mode to make your phone less interesting
- Log out of apps so you have to re-login (creates friction)
- Calculate how many hours you waste and remind yourself
- Use app blockers like Freedom or TimeLimit
- Replace scrolling with something better like reading or exercise
- Tell a friend your goal so they can help you stay accountable
